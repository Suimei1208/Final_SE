This is a Winform project built with Visual Studio 2022. To run the project, you need to open the Connection.cs file in the DAL class and change the data source to your SQL server.

Warehouse tab:
After changing the data source, run the form and log in with the username admin and password 123456789. Then, select the supplier name and click the ADD WAREHOUSE button. You will see the data added below. Click on the created data, and the details will be displayed in the adjacent table.

To add a new product, enter all required information and click the Save button. If you want to add another product, click the ADD PRODUCT button. You can cancel the operation by clicking the Cancel button.

The Cancel button allows you to add a new warehouse. To edit the detailed information in the table, click on the data and change the information above, then click the Edit button. The Delete button only works when you select data in the table and click the button. The Delete all button deletes all data in the detailed table. The Print PDF button prints a PDF file of the detailed table.

Stock issue tab:
You can select the ID in the option or click on the data in the left table and change the Status and Payment Status. Then, click the Confirm button. The Print PDF button prints the table on the right.

Statistic and Ranking tab:
Select the month and year to display the corresponding data.

Web Form:
All features are the same as in the Win Form (if you log in with admin and 123456789). If you log in with this account:
Username: user1
Password: 123456
The browser will automatically redirect you to the agents' order page, where you can select products and quantities, add them to your cart, select a payment method, and press Payment.
